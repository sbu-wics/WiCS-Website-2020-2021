		<h2>Grace Hopper Celebration Scholarship</h2>
        <center>
            <img src="images/blog/GHC-Cover.png" style="width: 496px">
        </center>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sejal Mehra and I‚Äôm currently a senior majoring in computer
            engineering with a minor in entrepreneurship and in the Women in Science and
            Engineering (WISE) Honors Program here at Stony Brook University. I am currently a
            Lead Mentor with the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) Peer
            Mentoring Program, executive board member for the Society of Women Engineers
            Chapter, alumni of Girls Who Code, and as a BUILTBYGIRLS Ambassador. I also have
            extensive professional experience with companies such as Viacom (now ViacomCBS),
            Microsoft, and littleBits.<br>
            
            I am so grateful to be a WiCS Virtual Grace Hopper Conference (vGHC) Scholarship
            recipient this year! This conference was definitely an experience I will never forget as
            I‚Äôve wanted to attend Grace Hopper since my freshman year and this was my first time
            attending! This experience was definitely unique in that everything, whether it was the
            opening keynote with Serena Williams, the various speaking engagements, the
            workshops, the closing virtual dance party and even the networking sessions, was virtual
            due to COVID-19. It was amazing to see so many like-minded females throughout the
            conference and how excited they were to meet me! I was overwhelmed by how many
            companies and recruiters reached out to me, as soon as I was registered to attend.
            Through this conference, I was able to network with various recruiters who guided me
            through the application and interview process for companies, which eventually led me
            to grow my network further. The sense of community I felt through this conference was
            beyond incredible and you definitely don‚Äôt feel alone being a woman in STEM. Even
            though the conference was held virtually, I think the experience was something I will
            never forget and hope that one day every female in STEM gets an opportunity to attend
            this conference.</p>
